TODO
	-Fix multi-NPC animations ** There is a bug where if you need to pass a div who's size differs from the passing div because of extra lines (caused by new resources, usually), then it just fails to do so and hangs in a non-organized position. Couldn't repeat bug on first run of code, ever. Continue to debug as Yathi's code changes.
	-Add Lorem Ipsum for the Extra pages
	-Add django cookie
    -Fix that navbar nonesense
    -Finalize deployment details
    -Add new emotion representation
    -Possibly remove db side of site
    
    -Eventually make a button which reinitializes the server




    - ON page reresh, if someone failed a pass the name on the side is smaller
    - When the step is "the switch", you need to check whoever's getting popped, and delete their html. We now have the issue that the person in front has the ID of 2, instead of 1. Is this an issue though? Investigate.
    - No passing will actually happen since teh list of passing NPCs is always empty. Need to update that list and pass it on. -- FIx the deletion first though, since if you don't the IDs will be screwed up.
    - graphs are out of order
    - side names don't get deleted
    - Does Yathi want absolute value shown in a different way? Like if it's negative, should be bar maybe change colors? Maybe a graph like:
                        | ------- [40%]
                        | --- [14%]
              [-20%]----| 

    - Make an animation signifying that the person is getting the oculus rift.
