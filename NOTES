TODO
	-Add Lorem Ipsum for the Extra pages
    -Fix that navbar nonesense
    -Finalize deployment details
    -Possibly remove db side of site
    
    -Eventually make a button which reinitializes the server




    - ON page reresh, if someone failed a pass the name on the side is smaller

    - on page refresh, if the npc had a pass fail, the outline is clear


    Need a button which resets the game entirely.


    -when 0.4 translates to 4%
    -disable the button listener whenever you are playing an animation
    - modularize the updateNPCs function into smaller functions
