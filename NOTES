TODO
	-Fix multi-NPC animations ** There is a bug where if you need to pass a div who's size differs from the passing div because of extra lines (caused by new resources, usually), then it just fails to do so and hangs in a non-organized position. Couldn't repeat bug on first run of code, ever. Continue to debug as Yathi's code changes.
	-Add Lorem Ipsum for the Extra pages
	-Add django cookie
    -Fix that navbar nonesense
    -Finalize deployment details
    -Add new emotion representation
    -Possibly remove db side of site
    
    -Eventually make a button which reinitializes the server




    - ON page reresh, if someone failed a pass the name on the side is smaller

    - graph values can go much farther than 100%, extending past the thingy
    - on page refresh, if the npc had a pass fail, the outline is clear


    Need a button which resets the game entirely.

    -- WEDNESDAY MORNING*****
    Bascially, the scoreboard on the right is slow to update. Don't know why. There must be some pending operation slowing it down.
    Also, occaisionally, not all of the elements are actually going to move. This may alos ahve to do with some pending animation.
    Maybe check if there is a way of testing "Is ongoing animation?"


    -when 0.4 translates to 4%
    -Grey out the 'next step' button on finish and make it green againnnnn
    -disable the button listener whenever you are playing an animation
