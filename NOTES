TODO
	-Fix multi-NPC animations ** There is a bug where if you need to pass a div who's size differs from the passing div because of extra lines (caused by new resources, usually), then it just fails to do so and hangs in a non-organized position. Couldn't repeat bug on first run of code, ever. Continue to debug as Yathi's code changes.
	-Add Lorem Ipsum for the Extra pages
	-Add django cookie
    -Fix that navbar nonesense
    -Finalize deployment details
    -Add new emotion representation
    -Possibly remove db side of site
    
    -Eventually make a button which reinitializes the server




    - ON page reresh, if someone failed a pass the name on the side is smaller

    - Does Yathi want absolute value shown in a different way? Like if it's negative, should be bar maybe change colors? Maybe a graph like:
                        | ------- [40%]
                        | --- [14%]
              [-20%]----| 

    - Make an animation signifying that the person is getting the oculus rift. 




    Need a button which resets the game entirely.
