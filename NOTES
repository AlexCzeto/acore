TODO
	-Fix multi-NPC animations ** There is a bug where if you need to pass a div who's size differs from the passing div because of extra lines (caused by new resources, usually), then it just fails to do so and hangs in a non-organized position. Couldn't repeat bug on first run of code, ever. Continue to debug as Yathi's code changes.
	-Add Lorem Ipsum for the Extra pages
	-Add django cookie
    -Fix that navbar nonesense
    -Finalize deployment details
    -Add new emotion representation
    -Possibly remove db side of site
    
    -Eventually make a button which reinitializes the server
